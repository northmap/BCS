"8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Magilligan Foreland, located along the eastern side of Lough Foyle, is a significant and dynamic coastal landform. With funding from the Historic Environment Fund Research Stream, CCGHT is working with volunteers to record and monitor archaeological sites along the Lough Foyle shoreline of Magilligan (aka Magilligan Strand) that are at risk from coastal erosion.<br><br>Magilligan Foreland comprises 32 km2 of low-lying sand-dominated terrain that formed in association with changes in relative sea-level over the last ~7000 years. Erosion of the sand cliffs alongside Lough Foyle has revealed alternations of beach sediments, peat beds, buried soils, and dune sands. These different materials are best seen along a 4 km-long section of the coast from the townlands of Ballymagoland, in the north, to Ballymultimber, in the south. Along other sections of Magilligan Strand the sand cliffs are obscured by rubble and other materials emplaced to reduce wave erosion of the cliff line and adjacent agricultural land. During the 1980s several radiocarbon dates were obtained on samples of buried organic materials (peat, wood, soil and shells) collected from the cliffs. These gave ages between ~5000 years and 200 years before present and confirmed that in general terms Magilligan Foreland developed gradually from south to north.<br><br>People have lived in and used this changing landscape over thousands of years, and as such Magilligan has an interesting archaeological heritage but one that is not yet fully understood. The Lough Foyle shoreline is currently experiencing significant erosion, making the archaeological heritage vulnerable and resulting in its rapid loss. Over the 9 km length of coastline between Magilligan Point and Balls Point (at the mouth of the River Roe), there are 17 recorded archaeological sites and 10 recorded defence heritage sites. Walkers often find sites and objects that have been revealed after stormy weather and high tides. In 1979 and 1984 excavations were carried out by archaeologists from Queen’s University on shell middens that had become visible in the cliffs at Oughtymore and Ballymulholland. Radiocarbon dates indicated that the middens were formed during the Iron Age, Early Christian and Medieval periods. The middens indicated significant human activity in the area during those periods. Remains of archaeological burials have also been revealed in the eroding sands and subsequently excavated. The details and results of one such burial, found in 2024, are awaited with interest.<br><br>In 2023 and 2024, volunteers participated in walks along Magilligan Strand that led to the discovery of additional archaeological sites. These newly identified sites were added to the Northern Ireland Sites and Monuments Record. Funding has enabled us to form a dedicated volunteer group to monitor the coastline seasonally, recording new sites and updating records for existing sites.<br><br>We cannot protect and preserve all these sites, but by recording and monitoring them on a regular basis we can pinpoint their locations and extents, note the nature of their contained materials (e.g. shells, stone, charcoal, bone and metal slag) and highlight those worthy of further detailed research before they are ultimately destroyed.",Citizen Science at Magilligan Strand,-6.986446,55.118009,Historic Environment Projects,<img src=https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Volunteers-scaled.jpg>,Sites for Binevenagh map,https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Volunteers-scaled.jpg,

Building of the Magilligan tower began in 1812 and was not finished until 1817. The Martello Tower, along with Greencastle Martello Tower located directly across Lough Foyle in Co. Donegal was strategically positioned to protect Lough Foyle. The circular tower is built of dressed stone, 10m high, 12m in diameter, tapering slightly upwards. The entrance at first floor level was by retractable ladder and the five-corbelled machicolation above gave added protection. The ground floor was a where powder and ammunition was stored, and at basement level there was a large water cistern. The first floor provided accommodation for the soldier and their officer, On the top floor or roof there was a 24-pounder cannon on a central pivot and circular rail.

The fort is located on a rocky outcrop which was further protected by a thick wall which which still survives in places. Although very overgrown, the Ordnance Survey memoirs record that in the 1830s the fort had rock cut steps and a collapsed souterrain. Today this is known as the Giants Sconce with ‘sconce’ meaning a small fortification often located on a mound. However, in historical writings, the site was referred to as Dún dá Bend and Dun Ceithrin. Dun Ceithrin or the Giant’s Sconce is considered a ‘royal site’ which means that in early medieval literature it was important politically, associated with the high kings in Ulster at the time. Royal sites usually have a prophecy associated with them. Other ‘royal sites’ in Ulster are Dunserverick, Co. Antrim and Emain Macha/Navan Fort, Co. Armagh.

"11",,,,,,Artikelly,,,,,,,,"The WW2 Anti-Aircraft Dome Trainer located in the former Limavady Airfield, one of the most unique defence heritage sites in Northern Ireland. This building was used by the RAF to train flight bombers and gunners during the Second World War. Between 1942 and 1944 forty-four concrete and steel domes were built on airfields across the UK, and only 6 survive today, with this being the only example in Northern Ireland so its nationally significant and it protected as a scheduled archaeological site is also classified as a building at risk. Internally images of enemy aircraft were projected onto the interior of the dome and fired at by a replica anti-aircraft gun. Only half of the dome’s inner surface was used as a target screen as the rest was lined with sound absorbent material to limit echoes. Kodak and Technicolour developed a sophisticated simulator which projected film onto the interior walls of the dome via a 35mm camera which was positioned on a pair of concrete piers in the middle of the dome. Through the use of movable mirrors and cameras the image of the aircraft from the film could be projected onto the wall for the dome and moved to simulate a realistic image of being divebombed during an enemy attack. The trainee gunner was positioned behind the projector and mirror set-up at his replica gun. When the gunner pulled the trigger, a soundtrack played the noise of a firing shot with a duration of approximately five seconds, which was the time it took to empty the cartridge of ammunition. The noise of the attacking aircraft was recorded on the soundtrack of the film. The sound effects presented a realistic feeling to the trainee gunner of being attacked and having to respond. This was an immersive experience was really early stages of virtual reality in action and a forebearer of video gaming. With funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and permission from the landowner, the Binevenagh and Coastal Lowlands Landscape Partnership will conserve the Limavady Dome Trainer through a strategy of curated decay. This will retain the structure in its current condition, providing only minimal localised repairs to the external render and waterproof coating, serving to arrest the ongoing decay. Inside, interpretation and the story of the Binevenagh area in WW2 will be projected on to the surface of the dome, honouring the original audio-visual function of the structure. In addition, the conserved dome will provide a multi-purpose community event space for activities, events and functions.

"13",,,,,,Mulkeeragh,,,,,,,,"From November 2021- November 2023, a group of over 20 volunteers carried out detailed fieldwork and local research to find traces of the original Ordnance Survey carried out in the area during the mid-nineteenth century. This project called 'Mapping Monuments' was led by Professor Keith Lilley from Queens University Belfast (QUB) Completed by 1846, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, led by Lt Col Thomas Colby, was the first large-scale mapping of an entire country. The extremely flat geomorphology of the Lough Foyle Alluvial Plain played an important role during the mapping as it was the location of the Lough Foyle Baseline, a vital component which ensured the mapping was accurate. In fact, at 8 miles long, the Lough Foyle Baseline was the longest baseline of its kind anywhere in the world. Although the line is invisible, its presence is marked and protected by the three precisely aligned unique circular ‘towers’ constructed by the surveyors. These are now designated listed buildings. The Basetower at Ballykelly (HB02/10/012) is publicly accessible, while those at Minearny (HB02/09/008) and Ballymullholland (HB02/09/014) are in private ownership and can only be accessed with permission. As well as the basetowers, remnants of successive years of survey can be seen in the benchmarks (sometimes referred to as crow’s feet) which are distinctive markings that have been chiselled onto walls, buildings and bridges. Although these benchmarks have no heritage designation or protection, they are a tangible piece of heritage recognisable to the public, but under threat from development and construction. Through desk-based research, 208 potential benchmarks were identified, the locations of 146 of these were visited by volunteers of which 40 were found to still survive. The volunteers contributed 860 hours to the project.

Three of the volunteers who worked on the project (Bridgeen Rutherford, Michael Cory and Peter Wilson) each gave a presentation at the conference. The research undertaken by the volunteers was then developed into a touring exhibition.

The archaeologists were helped by a team of 13 volunteers and 171 school students from the local area. The excavation investigated 3 features commonly found on WW1 battlefields: a communication trench, a crenelated fire trench dating to 1915-16; and a possible section of frontline trench. Within the trenches, the remains of sandbag revetting and sandbag breastwork were found which provided the trenches with force protection and structural support. Very few WW1 related artefacts were found, however a ‘Silent’ screw picket was found. This type of picket was used within trench warfare to construct barbwire defences. Possible XPM wire revetment (chicken wire) commonly used to support sandbag revetting within trenches was also uncovered. The excavated features provided important evidence of the past training at Magilligan have resulted in a fuller understanding of the relict trench systems. It has proven that the earthworks are indeed WW1 practice trenches and were designed to provide new recruits with training in the practice of spadework and entrenchment.
