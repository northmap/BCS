8,,,,,,Sconce,,,,,,,,"The Giant’s Sconce, located close to the Windyhill Road, is a scheduled archaeological monument which was in use between the 5th and 7th centuries. The fort is located on a rocky outcrop which was further protected by a thick wall which which still survives in places. Although very overgrown, the Ordnance Survey memoirs record that in the 1830s the fort had rock cut steps and a collapsed souterrain. Today this is known as the Giants Sconce with ‘sconce’ meaning a small fortification often located on a mound. However, in historical writings, the site was referred to as Dún dá Bend and Dun Ceithrin. Dun Ceithrin or the Giant’s Sconce is considered a ‘royal site’ which means that in early medieval literature it was important politically, associated with the high kings in Ulster at the time. Royal sites usually have a prophecy associated with them. Other ‘royal sites’ in Ulster are Dunserverick, Co. Antrim and Emain Macha/Navan Fort, Co. Armagh. In 2023 and 2024, volunteers who completed the OCN Level 2 Tour Guide Training with Binevenagh and Coastal Lowlands Landscape Partnership lead walking tours of the site as part of Castlerock Walkfest.",Giant's Sconce,-6.790559,55.109892,Historic Environment Projects,<img src=https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Giants-Sconce-scaled.jpg>,Sites for Binevenagh map,https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Giants-Sconce-scaled.jpg,
9,,,,,,Artikelly,,,,,,,,"The WW2 Anti-Aircraft Dome Trainer located in the former Limavady Airfield, one of the most unique defence heritage sites in Northern Ireland. This building was used by the RAF to train flight bombers and gunners during the Second World War. Between 1942 and 1944 forty-four concrete and steel domes were built on airfields across the UK, and only 6 survive today, with this being the only example in Northern Ireland so its nationally significant and it protected as a scheduled archaeological site is also classified as a building at risk. Internally images of enemy aircraft were projected onto the interior of the dome and fired at by a replica anti-aircraft gun. Only half of the dome’s inner surface was used as a target screen as the rest was lined with sound absorbent material to limit echoes. Kodak and Technicolour developed a sophisticated simulator which projected film onto the interior walls of the dome via a 35mm camera which was positioned on a pair of concrete piers in the middle of the dome. Through the use of movable mirrors and cameras the image of the aircraft from the film could be projected onto the wall for the dome and moved to simulate a realistic image of being divebombed during an enemy attack. The trainee gunner was positioned behind the projector and mirror set-up at his replica gun. When the gunner pulled the trigger, a soundtrack played the noise of a firing shot with a duration of approximately five seconds, which was the time it took to empty the cartridge of ammunition. The noise of the attacking aircraft was recorded on the soundtrack of the film. The sound effects presented a realistic feeling to the trainee gunner of being attacked and having to respond. This was an immersive experience was really early stages of virtual reality in action and a forebearer of video gaming. With funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and permission from the landowner, the Binevenagh and Coastal Lowlands Landscape Partnership will conserve the Limavady Dome Trainer through a strategy of curated decay. This will retain the structure in its current condition, providing only minimal localised repairs to the external render and waterproof coating, serving to arrest the ongoing decay. Inside, interpretation and the story of the Binevenagh area in WW2 will be projected on to the surface of the dome, honouring the original audio-visual function of the structure. In addition, the conserved dome will provide a multi-purpose community event space for activities, events and functions. Our application for planning permission to the conserve the dome and allow public access has been submitted, and if successful we hope to commence conservation work in early 2025 with a view to opening the facility to the public in early 2026.",RAF Anti-aircraft Training Dome,-6.934358,55.068682,Historic Environment Projects,<img src=https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Magilligan-Excavation-Training-Dome.jpg>,Sites for Binevenagh map,https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Magilligan-Excavation-Training-Dome.jpg,

The site is currently on MOD land but through partnership with the MOD, Causeway Coast and Glens Heritage Trust (CCGHT) will be taking on a lease for the site, enabling light touch conservation to the structures, interpretation and public access to the site for the first time in over 80 years. Conservation grazing will also be re-introduced to improve the habitat which is an Area of Special Scientific Interest. The site is a scheduled archaeological monument, and therefore archaeological excavation was required to investigate the site further. This work was greatly aided thanks to the help of inmates from HMP Magilligan. CCGHT hope to have the lease agreed by the end of 2024 which will enable the planning permission application to be submitted in early 2025.

11,,,,,,Mulkeeragh,,,,,,,,"From November 2021- November 2023, a group of over 20 volunteers carried out detailed fieldwork and local research to find traces of the original Ordnance Survey carried out in the area during the mid-nineteenth century. This project called 'Mapping Monuments' was led by Professor Keith Lilley from Queens University Belfast (QUB) Completed by 1846, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, led by Lt Col Thomas Colby, was the first large-scale mapping of an entire country. The extremely flat geomorphology of the Lough Foyle Alluvial Plain played an important role during the mapping as it was the location of the Lough Foyle Baseline, a vital component which ensured the mapping was accurate. In fact, at 8 miles long, the Lough Foyle Baseline was the longest baseline of its kind anywhere in the world. Although the line is invisible, its presence is marked and protected by the three precisely aligned unique circular ‘towers’ constructed by the surveyors. These are now designated listed buildings. The Basetower at Ballykelly (HB02/10/012) is publicly accessible, while those at Minearny (HB02/09/008) and Ballymullholland (HB02/09/014) are in private ownership and can only be accessed with permission. As well as the basetowers, remnants of successive years of survey can be seen in the benchmarks (sometimes referred to as crow’s feet) which are distinctive markings that have been chiselled onto walls, buildings and bridges. Although these benchmarks have no heritage designation or protection, they are a tangible piece of heritage recognisable to the public, but under threat from development and construction. Through desk-based research, 208 potential benchmarks were identified, the locations of 146 of these were visited by volunteers of which 40 were found to still survive. The volunteers contributed 860 hours to the project. Further information on the project can be viewed <a href=""https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c0fb603a471d4cc5928147a66077fdfc/""target=""_blank""><b>here</b></a>.<br><br>To mark the end of the project a conference was held in Ballykelly on Friday 17th November 2023. The conference was opened by broadcaster Joe Mahon who reflected on how one of the Ordnance Survey surveyors of the 1830s, John O’Donovan had influenced his career. Three of the volunteers who worked on the project (Bridgeen Rutherford, Michael Cory and Peter Wilson) each gave a presentation at the conference. The research undertaken by the volunteers was then developed into a touring exhibition. In addition to the conference and exhibition, Michael Cory, a Mapping Monuments volunteer and a retired surveyor, compiled his research into an article which was published as a free booklet ‘Mapping Monuments: The Lough Foyle Baseline’ charting the origins, practicalities and legacy of the baseline measurements.<br><br>Read the BBC report about the project, including a short video <a href=“https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-northern-ireland-64329296""target=""_blank""><b>here</b></a>.",Ballykelly Basetower,-7.007866,55.042786,Historic Environment Projects,<img src=https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-feature-Ballykelly-Base-Tower-scaled.jpg>,Sites for Binevenagh map,https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-feature-Ballykelly-Base-Tower-scaled.jpg,

13,,,,,,Lower Doaghs,,,,,,,,"In Autumn 2021, archaeologists from the Centre for Community Archaeology at Queen’s University led a 4 week community archaeological dig in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence. The archaeologists were helped by a team of 13 volunteers and 171 school students from the local area. The excavation investigated 3 features commonly found on WW1 battlefields: a communication trench, a crenelated fire trench dating to 1915-16; and a possible section of frontline trench. Within the trenches, the remains of sandbag revetting and sandbag breastwork were found which provided the trenches with force protection and structural support. Very few WW1 related artefacts were found, however a ‘Silent’ screw picket was found. This type of picket was used within trench warfare to construct barbwire defences. Possible XPM wire revetment (chicken wire) commonly used to support sandbag revetting within trenches was also uncovered. The excavated features provided important evidence of the past training at Magilligan have resulted in a fuller understanding of the relict trench systems. It has proven that the earthworks are indeed WW1 practice trenches and were designed to provide new recruits with training in the practice of spadework and entrenchment. The results of the dig will inform the ongoing management of the historic elements of the military estate’s historic landscape.",Magilligan Excavation,-6.951982,55.181403,Historic Environment Projects,<img src=https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Magilligan-Excavation-scaled.jpg>,Sites for Binevenagh map,https://ccght.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Binevenagh-Coastal-Survey-Magilligan-Excavation-scaled.jpg,
